**Laracogs** - A handful of tools for Laravel

[![Codeship](https://img.shields.io/codeship/013b03f0-a7c6-0133-63e0-5a0bf9327500.svg)](https://github.com/YABhq/Laracogs)

This is a set of tools to help speed up development of Laravel apps. You can start an app with various parts prewritten (Users, User Meta, Roles, Teams). And it comes with a powerful FormMaker which can generate form content from tables, and objects. It can generate epic CRUD prototypes rapidly with full testing scripts prepared for you, requiring very little editing. It also provides an elegant Cryptography tool which is URL friendly. Finally it brings along some friends with the LaravelCollective as a vendor.

## Website
[http://laracogs.com](http://laracogs.com)

## Detailed Documentation
Please consult the documentation here: [http://laracogs.com/docs](http://laracogs.com/docs)

## Requirements

1. PHP 5.5.9+
2. OpenSSL
3. Laravel 5.1+

----

### Installation

Start a new Laravel project:
```php
composer create-project laravel/laravel your-project-name
```

Then run the following to add Laracogs
```php
composer require "yab/laracogs"
```

Add this to the `config/app.php` in the providers array:
```php
Yab\Laracogs\LaracogsProvider::class
```

Time to publish those assets!
```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Yab\Laracogs\LaracogsProvider"
```

##### After these few steps you have the following tools at your fingertips:

## CRUD
The CRUD commands build a CRUD for a table with unit tests! Use the table-crud for tables that already exist.
```php
php artisan laracogs:crud {table} {--migration} {--bootstrap} {--semantic} {--schema}
php artisan laracogs:table-crud {table} {--migration} {--bootstrap} {--semantic}
```

## Docs
The docs can prepare documentation for business rules or prepare your app for API doc generation with Sami.
```php
php artisan laracogs:docs {action} {name=null} {version=null}
```

## Facades/ Utilities
Laracogs provides a handful of easy to use tools outside of the app starter kit, and CRUD builder:

#### Crypto
```php
Crypto::uuid();
Crypto::encrypt('string');
Crypto::decrypt('enc-string');
Crypto::shared()->encrypt('string');
Crypto::shared()->decrypt('enc-string');
```

#### FormMaker
```php
FormMaker::fromTable($table, $columns = null, $class = 'form-control', $view = null, $reformatted = true, $populated = false, $idAndTimestamps = false)
FormMaker::fromObject($object, $columns = null, $view = null, $class = 'form-control', $populated = true, $reformatted = false, $idAndTimestamps = false)
FormMaker::fromArray($array, $columns = null, $view = null, $class = 'form-control', $populated = true, $reformatted = false, $idAndTimestamps = false)
```

#### InputMaker
```php
InputMaker::label($name, $attributes = [])
InputMaker::create($name, $field, $object = null, $class = 'form-control', $reformatted = false, $populated = false)
```

----
You may also want to utilize our boilerplate generators, these tools will prepare your apps with starter kits, admins, user settings, notifications, billing integration, API access, Social Media logins, Bootstrap styles and more!
----

## Starter
In order to make use of the <u>starter kit</u> you will need to modify some files. Check out the modifications below:

Add the following to your `app/Http/Kernel.php` $routeMiddleware array.
```php
'admin' => \App\Http\Middleware\Admin::class,
'roles' => \App\Http\Middleware\Roles::class,
```

With the roles middleware you can specify which roles are applicable separating them with pipes: `['middlware' => ['roles:admin|moderator|member']]`

Update the `App\User::class` in: 'config/auth.php' and 'database/factory/ModelFactory.php' to this:
```php
App\Repositories\User\User::class
```

Add the following to 'app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php' in the boot method
```php
$gate->define('admin', function ($user) {
    return ($user->roles->first()->name === 'admin');
});

$gate->define('team-member', function ($user, $team) {
    return ($user->teams->find($team->id));
});
```

You will want to create an sqlite memory test database in the `config/database.php`
```php
'testing' => [
    'driver'   => 'sqlite',
    'database' => ':memory:',
    'prefix'   => '',
],
```

Add the following line to the 'phpunit.xml' file
```xml
<env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="testing"/>
<env name="MAIL_DRIVER" value="log"/>
```

##### For Laravel 5.2
You will also need to set the location of the email for password reminders. (config/auth.php - at the bottom)

```php
'passwords' => [
    'users' => [
        'provider' => 'users',
        'email' => 'emails.password',
        'table' => 'password_resets',
        'expire' => 60,
    ],
],
```

##### Things to note
You may try and start quickly by testing the registration but please make sure your app's <u>email</u> is configured or it will throw an exception.
You can do this in the `.env` file easily by setting it to 'log' temporarily

```php
MAIL_DRIVER=log
```

##### Last Steps

Once you've added in all these parts you will want to run the starter command!
```php
php artisan laracogs:starter
```

Then you'll need to migrate to add in the users, user meta, roles and teams tables. The seeding is run to set the initial roles for your application.
```php
php artisan migrate --seed
```

Once you get the starter kit running you can register and login to your app. You can then you can visit the settings section of the app and set your role to admin to take full control of the app.

Now its time for more boilerplate generators!

### Boostrap
----
Boostrap prepares your application with bootstrap as a view/ css framework.
```php
php artisan laracogs:bootstrap
```

### Semantic
----
Semantic prepares your application with semantic-ui as a view/ css framework.
```php
php artisan laracogs:semantic
```

<small>Please note that Billing and Notifications are only set for use with bootstrap</small>

### Notifications
----
Notifications prepares your application with a notification system.
```php
php artisan laracogs:notifications
```

### Socialite
----
Socialite prepares your application with a socialite system, with GitHub as the example:
```php
php artisan laracogs:socialite
```

### API
----
Api prepares your application with an API system using JWT (logins, and user profile):

```php
php artisan laracogs:api
```

### Billing
----
The billing command sets up your app with Laravel's cashier - it prepares the whole app to handle subscriptions with a policy structure.
```php
php artisan laracogs:billing
```

##### Requires
```php
composer require laravel/cashier
```

You may want to add this line to your navigation:
```php
<li><a href="{!! url('user/billing/details') !!}"><span class="fa fa-dollar"></span> Billing</a></li>
```

This to the app/Providers/ReouteServiceProvider.php:
```php
require app_path('Http/billing-routes.php');
```

This to the .env:
```php
SUBSCRIPTION=basic
STRIPE_SECRET=public-key
STRIPE_PUBLIC=secret-key
```

This to the app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php:
```php
$gate->define('access-billing', function ($user) {
    return ($user->meta->subscribed('main') && is_null($user->meta->subscription('main')->endDate));
});
```

For the `config/services.php` you will want yours to resemble:
```php
'stripe' => [
    'model'  => App\Repositories\UserMeta\UserMeta::class,
    'key'    => env('STRIPE_PUBLIC'),
    'secret' => env('STRIPE_SECRET'),
],
```

Finally run migrate to add the subscrptions and bind them to the user meta:
```php
php artisan migrate
```

You will also want to update your gulpfile.js to include the card.js, and subscription.js
```js
elixir(function(mix) {
    mix.scripts([
        'app.js',
        'card.js',
        'subscription.js'
    ]);
});
```

#### Accounts (Billing Only)

##### Plans
This is the basic config for `config/plans.php`. It sets the default subscription name, as well as the plans and the rules pertaining to them.

```
'subscription_name' => 'main',
'plans' => [
    'basic' => [
        'access' => [
            'some name'
        ],
        'limits' => [
            'Model\Namespace' => 5,
            'pivot_table' => 1
        ],
        'credits' => [
            'column' => 'credits_spent',
            'limit' => 10
        ],
        'custom' => [
            'anything' => 'anything'
        ],
    ],
]
```

##### Service
The service provides extra tools for handling restrictions in your application based on the plan the user subscribed to.
```php
getClause('box_limit');
canAccess('area_51');
cannotAccess('restricted_area');
getLimit('team_user');
withinLimit('App\Repositories\Team\Team');
creditsAvailable('App\Repositories\Team\Team');
creditsUsed('App\Repositories\Team\Team');
currentBillingCycle()->withinLimit('App\Repositories\Team\Team');
clause('custom', function($user, $subscription, $clause, $query) {
    // do your own logic!
    // model is optional if you dont provide it the query is null - otherwise is a query builder
}, 'App\Repositories\Team\Team');
```
